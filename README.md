Predicting Youth Smoking Prevalence Using Machine Learning

Project Overview:
Objective: The project aims to analyze and predict youth smoking prevalence based on different demographic and behavioral features using machine learning techniques.
Data Handling:
Data Cleaning: The data is preprocessed, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Feature Engineering: Features like age group, gender, and year are considered, and transformations like scaling are applied.
Modeling: Algorithms such as decision trees, logistic regression, or random forests are used to predict smoking prevalence among different youth demographics.
Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or other suitable measures.
Conclusion:
This project provides insights into how different factors contribute to youth smoking patterns, enabling policymakers or health organizations to target specific age groups or demographics for smoking cessation programs. The model's predictions can help identify at-risk groups and devise interventions accordingly.
